# MoreBots!

My new way of botting in osrs 

DISCLAIMER: Educational purposes. Botting is against Jagex rules if you dont wanna lose your account dont do this im doing this to learn automation and development skills 

My goals for this project are to further my python and programming knowlegde and bring anyone else who is also interested in programming and want to learn how I automate task in Old School Runescape with Python and follow my journey in becoming a better developer

About Me
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello fellow developers! A little about me. Im a self-taught developer who works a normal 9-5 job in a warehouse like an average person
and im on journey to teach myself programming skills and teach others who are maybe in the same situation as me. I've tried multiple methods of learning python. From cs150 - (free) to getting a google analytics cert - which hasnt done much for me tbh - (about who you know sometimes) I say theses things because I wanna come off as honest as I can be with everyone. Im here for the people who truely love learning the tech as myself. I started my learning journey back in 2021(on and off for about 2 years just didnt understand it in the beginning), school atmosphere just isnt for me. Im the type who has to see it in action for me to make use of the tool and for me runescape is the game ive played for well over 15 years of my life that I can make uses of python and what really sparked my skills to that next level I think and for those who also love the game and wanna learn python I think will get a lot out of this project.
